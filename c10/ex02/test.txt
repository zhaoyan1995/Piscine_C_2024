Chapter II
Foreword
Body Count is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles,
California, in 1990. The group is fronted by Ice-T, who co-founded the group
with lead guitarist Ernie C out of their interest in heavy metal music.
Ice-T took on the role of vocalist and writing the lyrics for most of
the group’s songs. Lead guitarist Ernie C has been responsible for writing
the group’s music. Their controversial self-titled debut album was released
on Sire Records in 1992.
The song "Cop Killer" was the subject of much controversy. Although Sire
Records’ parent company, Warner Bros. Records, defended the single,
Ice-T chose to remove the track from the album because he felt
that the controversy had eclipsed the music itself. The group left
Sire the following year. Since then, they have released three further
albums on different labels, none of which have been received as commercially
or critically well as their debut album.
Three out of the band’s original six members are deceased:
D-Roc died from lymphoma, Beatmaster V from leukemia and
Mooseman in a drive-by shooting.
